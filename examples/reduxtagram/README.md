# Reduxtagram

A simple React + [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.now.sh/) (Redux) implementation inspired from [Learn Redux course](https://learnredux.com/).

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) to run, build and test the application.

### Run the application

```shell
yarn dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### Run the tests

```shell
# run tests in interactive watch mode in the console
yarn test

# run tests in interactive watch mode and viewing the results in a browser - uses Vitest UI
yarn test --ui

# run tests with coverage and exit
yarn test --coverage --run
```

### Build and preview the application

```shell
# Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
