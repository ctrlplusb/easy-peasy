# Architecture

Under the hood we are abstracting Redux. Most complaints directed at Redux are typically in reference to the boilerplate associated with it. Easy Peasy provides you with a mechanism to avoid the boilerplate whilst taking advantage of the amazing guarantees that the Redux architecture provides.

We support the Redux Dev Tools out of the box and output a Redux store allowing interop with existing libraries. In addition to this we even allow extension of the underlying Redux store via middleware and enhancers. This provides the opportunity to integrate existing Redux libraries.

That all been said, absolutely no Redux experience is required to use Easy Peasy.
