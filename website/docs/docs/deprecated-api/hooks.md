# Hooks

In order to create more standardisation across the API, and avoid some ambiguity around the APIs the following hooks are considered deprecated.

The behaviour and arguments are the same for each of them. They have purely been renamed.

## useActions

This has been replaced by [useStoreActions](/docs/api/use-store-actions).

## useDispatch

This has been replaced by [useStoreDispatch](/docs/api/use-store-dispatch).

## useStore

This has been replaced by [useStoreState](/docs/api/use-store-state).
