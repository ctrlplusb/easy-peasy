# Recipes

This section contains a set of recipes for some common requests around configuring Easy Peasy or integrating it with other libraries.

For a full setup, look through the [examples using Easy Peasy on GitHub](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy/tree/master/examples).

If you have any recipes of your own we would invite you to submit a PR to get it added here.
