# Tutorial

This section will guide you through building an application that uses Easy Peasy to manage its state. We will start with the basics, defining some state, and will then gradually introduce each of the APIs (e.g. [action](/docs/api/action), [thunk](/docs/api/thunk), etc). 

Each section will end with a link to our [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) demo, with the newly introduced features being added to our application.
