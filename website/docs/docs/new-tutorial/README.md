# Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you Easy Peasy by refactoring [an application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k). We will step by step refactor [the application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k) whilst introducing the core concepts and APIs of Easy Peasy.

If you are looking for a quick fire overview then we recommend you read the [quickstart](/docs/introduction/quickstart).

[The application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k) that we are going to refactor is a naive shopping cart (what, no todo app!?!? ðŸ˜›). It lists some products and allows you to click a product and thereafter add it to your basket. You can also view your basket by clicking the link in the top right corner, which will display a list of the products currently added to your basket along with the ability to remove them.

In refactoring [the application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k) we will start with the state first, and then gradually introduce each of the APIs (e.g. [action](/docs/api/action), [thunk](/docs/api/thunk), etc).  We highly recommend that you familiarise yourself with the [target application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k) and invite you to fork it and perform the refactorings yourself as you progress through the tutorial.

Each section will end with a link to [the application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k) with the refactorings up to that point applied.

Have fun...
