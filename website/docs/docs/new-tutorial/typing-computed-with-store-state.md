# Typing computed properties accessing store state

It is possible to access the entire store state within your computed properties. This can be especially helpful if you require data from other parts of your model whilst computing the value. To illustrate this we will extend our model with a `products` and `basket` model.

## Extending our model

Ok, so let's first extend our model, so that we can produce a state where we would need to access the entire store state within our [computed](/docs/api/computed) property.

Firstly, we want some products.

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

interface ProductsModel {
  items: Product[];
}

const productsModel: ProductsModel = {
  items: [{ id: 1, name: 'Shoes', price: 20 }]
}
```

And now we would like a basket to represent the current products our customer wishes to purchase.

```typescript
interface BasketModel {
  productIds: number[];
}

const basketModel: BasketModel = {
  productIds: [1]
}
```

## Viewing our basket

We may now have the requirement to view our basket within our application. We could implement it like so.

```typescript
import { useStoreState } from '../store';

function Basket() {
  const productIds = useStoreState(state => state.basket.productIds);
  const products = useStoreState(state => state.products.items);

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Products in Basket</h2>
      <ul>
        {productIds.map(id => {
          const product = products.find(product => product.id === id);
          return <li>{product.name}</li>
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

As you can see every time we wish to view the products in our basket we have to map multiple pieces of our state. This may be okay in most cases, but if we needed to do this in multiple locations of our application we would have to duplicate this logic.  To avoid this we could define a [computed](/docs/api/computed) property.

## Defining a computed property for the basket products

Using our extended models, lets define a [computed](/docs/api/computed) property on the basket model that allows us to get the products that are in our basket. This [computed](/docs/api/computed) property will require the state from the products model in order to do this.

```typescript
import { Computed, ResolvedState2 } from 'easy-peasy';
import { Product } from './products';
import { StoreModel } from './model';

interface BasketModel {
  productIds: number[];
  // üëá our computed property
  productsInBasket: Computed<
    BasketModel, // üëà lives on the basket model
    Product[], // üëà will return an array of products
    ResolvedState2<number[], Product[]>, // üëà will use two pieces of resolved
                                         //     state. An array of numbers, and
                                        //      and array of products.
    StoreModel // üëà the store model to ensure our store state resolver is typed
  >
}
```

Note the import of the `ResolvedState2` type. Easy Peasy includes a set of types that can be used to represent the types for the resolved state that your `stateResolvers` will resolve. Remember, the `stateResolvers` are an array of functions that you provide as the 2nd argument to your [computed](/docs/api/computed) properties which allow you to resolve and isolate the local/store state that your [computed](/docs/api/computed) property will use to derive their value.

In this case we expect to have two state resolvers, so we have therefore used the `ResolvedState2` type. We export 5 variations of this type; `ResolvedState1`, `ResolvedState2`, `ResolvedState3`, `ResolvedState4`, and `ResolvedState5`. These allow you to represent the expected types for your state resolvers when you are using one, two, three, four, or five state resolvers respectively. Please notify us via the GitHub issues should you need more than five state resolvers.

## Implementing the computed property

We will not provide the implementation for the [computed](/docs/api/computed) property.

```typescript
const basketModel: BasketModel = {
  productIds: [1],
  productsInBasket: computed(
    (productIds, products) => productIds.map(id => 
      products.find(product => product.id === id)
    ),
    // üëá note our state resolvers, resolving two pieces of state
    [
      state => state.productIds,
      // this state resolver uses store state, accessing the products
      //      üëá                      üëá
      (_, storeState) => storeState.products.items
    ]
  )
}
```

## Accessing the computed property

We can now access the [computed](/docs/api/computed) property the same as any other piece of state.

```typescript
import { useStoreState } from 'easy-peasy';

function BasketProducts() {
  const products = useStoreState(state => state.basket.productsInBasket);
  return (
    <ul>
      {products.map(product => <li>{product.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

If the `basket.productIds` or `products.items` states change then our computed property will be updated and our component will re-render accordingly. üëç
