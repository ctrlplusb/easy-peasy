# Examples

## Todo List

A simple implementation of a todo list that utilises a mock service to illustrate data fetching/persisting via effect actions. A fully stateful app with no class components. Hot dang hooks are awesome.

This GitHub repository shows off how to utilise Typescript with Easy Peasy. I highly recommend cloning it and running it so that you can experience first hand what a joy it is to have types helping you with global state.
