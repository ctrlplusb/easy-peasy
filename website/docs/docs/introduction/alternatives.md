# Alternatives

We aren't suggesting that Easy Peasy is _the_ state management solution for React. It's just one of the options. State management is a certainly a tricky subject within the React eco system. There are a variety of options available to you. We don't want to encourage unhealthy competition and truly appreciate the various options available to the community. We therefore believe it is our responsibility to inform you of some of your options, and encourage you to choose a solution that best meets the needs of your application.

- [React's Context and/or Hook APIs](#reacts-context-andor-hook-apishttpsreactjsorgdocsgetting-startedhtml)
- [Zustand](#zustandhttpsgithubcompmndrszustand)
- [Redux Toolkit](#redux-toolkithttpsredux-toolkitjsorg)

## [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)

Firstly, do you even need state management?? ðŸ˜…

If you find that the primary requirement for your state management solution is data synchronization with a server (e.g. GET and POST requests) then you could almost certainly get away with using [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) instead.

I highly recommend that you read their [overview](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/overview) docs for a strong motivation on why you should consider them.

Honestly, I've created a fully featured CRUD application in React utilizing `react-query` and I wholeheartedly endorse this library. It reduces application complexity dramatically and prevents you from hitting a whole category of bugs that can occur when you are trying to manage client/server data synchronization via a state management solution.

## [React's Context and/or Hook APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Please consider using the native API's that React has to offer. They are built into the library so will have greater support and much bigger chance of being supported for an extended period of time.

You'll be surprised with how far these APIs can take you.

## [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

Zustand has a beautifully elegant API, and whilst it isn't as rich in features as Easy Peasy, it can global state management needs for a large portion of React applications.

I haven't used it directly as of yet, but I have been keeping my eye on it and believe it to be a very strong solution.

Here is a strong motivation for its usage extracted from their readme:

> Don't disregard it because it's cute. It has quite the claws, lots of time was spent to deal with common pitfalls, like the dreaded zombie child problem, react concurrency, and context loss between mixed renderers. It may be the one state-manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

A big bonus is that they growing in popularity at a great rate. Community is a great force for an open source effort, and an important factor in ensuring you will get support and can depend on the lifetime of the project.

## [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

An official Redux library providing a simplified API interface that avoids boilerplate. It great simplifies the specification of a Redux store. Once you've created the store you'll need to install and use the [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) library to connect it to your application.

If you are wanting to engage the Redux ecosystem then this alternative has a big benefit in that it is officially part of that Eco System, and subsequently has a larger community.

A special shoutout goes to @acemarke for his continued stewardship of the Redux ecosystem. This library continues take a lot of learnings from him.
