# Installation

Firstly, you'll need to make sure that you have React and React DOM installed.
Please ensure you install versions >= 16.8.0 for both `react` and `react-dom`, as
this library depends on the hooks feature of React.

```bash
npm install react
npm install react-dom
```

Then install Easy Peasy.

```bash
npm install easy-peasy@3.0.0-rc.0
```

We're off to the races!
