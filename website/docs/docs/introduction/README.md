# Introduction

Easy Peasy is an abstraction of Redux. It provides a reimagined API focussing on
<strong>developer experience</strong>, allowing you to <strong>quickly</strong>
and <strong>easily</strong> manage your state, whilst leveraging the strong
<strong>architectural guarantees</strong> and providing integration with the
extensive <strong>eco-system</strong> that Redux has to offer.

Batteries are included - <strong>no configuration</strong> is required to
support a <strong>robust</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> state management
solution that includes advanced features such as derived state, API calls,
<strong>developer tools</strong>, and fully typed experience via
<strong>TypeScript</strong>.
