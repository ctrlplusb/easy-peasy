# Final Notes

We hope you found the tutorial useful. If it was at all unclear, or lacking in any way, we would encourage you to submit a PR to improve them or open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy) page.  Each page has a link at the bottom of it which will allow you to quickly draft an edit and submit it to us.

The tutorial does cover almost all of the Easy Peasy API, however, it is still recommended that you reference the individual docs for each of the APIs available to you.
