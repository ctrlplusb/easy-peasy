# Installation

Before we can do anything we'll need to ensure that Easy Peasy and its
dependencies are installed.

Firstly, you'll need to make sure that you have React and React DOM installed.
Please ensure you install versions >= 16.8.0 for both `react` and `react-dom`, as

npm install react
npm install react-dom

```bash
npm install easy-peasy
