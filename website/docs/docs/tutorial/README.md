# Tutorial

Within this tutorial you will learn Easy Peasy by refactoring [an existing application](https://codesandbox.io/s/8qz5k). We will refactor [the application](https://codesandbox.io/s/easy-peasy-tutorial-start-8qz5k) in a step by step manner, introducing each of the core concepts and APIs of Easy Peasy as we progress.

> If you are looking for a quick fire overview then we recommend you read the [quickstart tutorial](/docs/quick-start.html).

[The application](https://codesandbox.io/s/8qz5k) that we are going to refactor is a naive shopping cart. It lists some products and allows you to add a product to your basket. You can additionally view your basket and remove products from it.

In refactoring [the application](https://codesandbox.io/s/8qz5k) we will define the state first, thereafter we will gradually introduce each of the APIs (e.g. [action](/docs/api/action.html), [thunk](/docs/api/thunk.html), etc). 

We recommend that you familiarise yourself with the [target application](https://codesandbox.io/s/8qz5k) before you proceed, and invite you to fork it and perform the refactoring described within each section of the tutorial. The tutorial will show _all_ the code changes that are required.

Each section will end with a link to a snapshot of [the application](https://codesandbox.io/s/8qz5k) with the refactoring up to that point applied to it.

We hope that you find this tutorial helpful and invite you to provide feedback on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy).
