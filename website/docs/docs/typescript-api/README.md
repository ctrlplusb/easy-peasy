# TypeScript API

This section provides you with an overview of the primary types you are likely to use from Easy Peasy.

Generally you only need to explicitly import and use the types when defining your model interfaces.

If you are unfamiliar with using Easy Peasy with TypeScript then we would recommend that you read the [TypeScript tutorial](/docs/typescript-tutorial/).
