# persist

This helper allows you to persist your store state (to `sessionStorage` by default) allowing the persisted state to be rehydrated whenever your store recreated (e.g. on page refresh).

> ***FYI:*** *This API is _heavily_ inspired by [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist), with the intention of providing a lot of compatibility with it so that we can leverage the packages that exist within it's ecosystem. Love and thanks goes to to that team and community for the hard work they did in establishing some of these patterns*

**Configuring your store to persist**

To utilise this feature you simply need to wrap your model you wish to persist with the helper.

```javascript
import { persist } from 'easy-peasy';

const store = createStore(
  persist({
    count: 1,
    inc: action(state => {
      state.count += 1;
    })
  })
);
```

In the example above we are persisting the state for our entire store, but you can alternatively target specific parts of your model to persist:

```javascript
const store = createStore(
  products: productsModel,
  basket: persist(basketModel),
  session: persist(sessionModel)
);
```

Every time your state changes it will be saved to the configured storage engine (`sessionStorage` by default).

> ***Note:*** *Each persist instance can have it's own unique configuration, although we would recommend utilizing the same configuration across all instances.*

**Ensuring latest store state has persisted**

The persist operations (i.e. saving to the storage engine) are batched so that we don't continuously run write operations against your storage engine - this avoids thrashing where you may have a store that receives frequent updates.

Currently the persist operations are debounced, ensuring that a maximum of 1 write operation is executed every second.

> ***Note:*** *The debounce rate will be made configurable within a future update.*

Therefore it is important to consider that persist operations may be delayed, and manage this by introducing logic within your application which will ensure that any outstanding persist operations have completed prior to performing an action that will cause your application to unmount. For e.g. a page refresh, or navigating away from your site.

[Store instances](/docs/api/store.html) contain an extended API that allow you to do support this. Specifically, the `store.persist.flush()` API will immediately execute any outstanding persist operations and return a `Promise` that resolves when the persist operations have completed.

Below is an example of how you might introduce some guarding logic that makes use of this API.

```javascript
import store from './store';

const refreshPage = async () => {
  // Firstly ensure that any outstanding persist operations are complete.
  // Note that this is an asynchronous operation so we will await on it.
  await store.persist.flush();

  // we can now safely reload the page
  window.document.reload();
}
```

**Rehydrating your store**

Every time your store is created, any data that has been persisted will be used to rehydrate your state accordingly. Some storage engines operate in an asynchronous manner, therefore, it is best practice to ensure that the data rehydration has completed prior to rendering the parts of your application that depend on the persisted state.

> ***Note:*** *Even if you are 100% sure that your storage engine is synchronous we still recommend that you utilise one of the strategies below. It will only reduce the risk of your application performing in an unexpected manner should you ever inadvertently introduce a persist configuration that utilises an asynchronous storage engine*

There are two strategies that you can employ in regards to ensure data rehydration has completed.

*Strategy 1: Wait for the rehydration to complete prior to rendering the entire application*

The [store instances](/docs/api/store.html) contains an API allowing to gain a handle on when the rehydration process has completed, specifically `store.persist.resolveRehydration()`. Wehen you execute this API you will receive back a `Promise`. The `Promise` will resolve when the data rehydration has completed.

Therefore you can wait on this `Promise` prior to rendering your application, which would ensure that your application is rendered with the expected rehydrated state.

```javascript
const store = createStore(persist(model));

store.persist.resolveRehydration().then(() => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <StoreProvider store={store}>
      <App />
    </StoreProvider>,
    document.getElementById('app')
  );
});
```

*Strategy 2: Eagerly render your application and utilise the `useStoreRehydrated` hook*

You can alternatively partially render your application, utilising the [`useStoreRehydrated`](/docs/api/use-store-rehydrated.html) hook to wait for rehydration to complete prior to rendering the parts of your application that depend on the rehydrated state.

```javascript
import { useStoreRehydrated } from 'easy-peasy';

const store = createStore(persist(model));

function App() {
  const rehydrated = useStoreRehydrated();
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      {rehydrated ? <Main /> : <div>Loading...</div>}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <StoreProvider store={store}>
    <App />
  </StoreProvider>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

In the example above, the `<Main />` content will not render until our store has been successfully updated with the rehydration state.

## API

Below is the API of the `persist` helper.

Please be aware that [Store instances](/docs/api/store.html) contain additional APIs relating to persistence; for example - allowing you to ensure all outstanding persist operations complete prior to navigating away from your application. We highly recommend you read the examples in the docs below and familiarize yourself with the API of [Store instances](/docs/api/store.html).

  - `model` (Object, *required*)

    The model that you wish to apply persistence to.

    > You can surround your entire model, or a nested model. You can even have multiple `persist` configurations scattered throughout your store's model. Feel free to use the API on the parts of your state feel most appropriate for persistence/rehydration.

  - `config` (Object, *optional*)

    You can provide a second parameter to your `persist` instances, which represents a configuration for the instance.

    ```javascript
    const model = persist(
      {
        counter: 0,
        todos: [],
        increment: (state) => {
          state.counter += 1;
        }
      },
      // ðŸ‘‡ configuration
      {
        whitelist: ['counter'], // We will only persist the "counter" state
      }
    );
    ```

    The configuration object supports the following properties:

    - `blacklist` (Array<string>, *optional*)

      A list of keys, representing the parts of the model that should not be persisted. Any part of the model that is not represented in this list will be persisted.

    - `whitelist` (Array<string>, *optional*)

      A list of keys, representing the parts of the model that should be persisted. Any part of the model that is not represented in this list will not be persisted.

    - `mergeStrategy` (string, *optional*)

      The strategy that should be employed when rehydrating the persisted state over your store's initial state.

      The following values are supported:

      - `'merge'` (*default*)

        The data from the persistence will be _shallow_ merged with the initial state represented by your store's model.

        i.e.

        Given the following persisted state:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "apple",
          "address": {
            "city": "cape town"
          }
        }
        ```

        And the following initial state represented by your store's model:

        ```json
        {
          "address": {
            "city": "london",
            "post code": "e3 1pq"
          },
          "animal": "dolphin"
        }
        ```

        The resulting state will be:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "apple",
          "address": {
            "city": "cape town"
          },
          "animal": "dolphin"
        }
        ```

      - `'overwrite'`

        The data from the persistence will _completely_ overwrite the initial state represented by your store's model.

        i.e.

        Given the following persisted state:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "apple",
          "city": "cape town"
        }
        ```

        And the following initial state represented by your store's model:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "pear",
          "animal": "dolphin"
        }
        ```

        The resulting state will be:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "apple",
          "city": "cape town"
        }
        ```

      - `'mergeDeep'`

        The data from the persistence will be merged deeply, recursing through all _object_ structures and merging.

        i.e.

        Given the following persisted state:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "apple",
          "address": {
            "city": "cape town"
          }
        }
        ```

        And the following initial state represented by your store's model:

        ```json
        {
          "address": {
            "city": "london",
            "post code": "e3 1pq"
          },
          "animal": "dolphin"
        }
        ```

        The resulting state will be:

        ```json
        {
          "fruit": "apple",
          "address": {
            "city": "cape town",
            "post code": "e3 1pq"
          },
          "animal": "dolphin"
        }
        ```

        > **Note:** Only *plain objects* will be recursed and merged; no other types such as Arrays, Maps, Sets, Classes etc.

    - `transformers` (Array<Transformer>, *optional*)

      Transformers are use to apply operations to your data during prior it being persisted or hydrated.

      One use case for a transformer is to handle data that can't be parsed to a JSON string. For example a `Map` or `Set`. To handle these data types you could utilise a transformer that converts the `Map`/`Set` to/from an `Array` or `Object`.

      Transformers are applied left to right during data persistence, and are applied right to left during data rehydration.

      [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) already has a robust set of [transformer packages](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#transforms) that have been built for it. These can be used here.

    - `storage` (string | Object, *optional*)

      The storage engine to be used. It defaults to `sessionStorage`. The following values are supported:

      - `'sessionStorage'`

        Use the browser's sessionStorage as the persistence layer.

        i.e. data is available for rehydration for a single browser session

      - `'localStorage'`

        Use the browser's localStorage as the persistence layer.

        i.e. data is available across browser sessions

      - Custom engine

        A custom storage engine.

        [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) already has a robust set of [storage engine packages](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#storage-engines) that have been built for it. These can be used here.

## Deleting all persisted data

Should you wish to remove all the data that has been persisted for your model you can utilise the [Store instance](/docs/api/store.html) API to do so.

```javascript
const store = createStore(model);

if (someCondition) {
  store.persist.clear().then(() => {
    console.log('Store has been cleared');
  });
}
```

Note that a `Promise` was returned, which when resolved indicates that the data has been removed from your persistence layers.

## Utilising `persist` within a dynamically added model

You can still utilise the `persist` API when using the [`store.addModel`](/docs/api/store.html) API to dynamically configure an additional model within your store.

Every time the model is added to your store we will attempt to rehydrate any persisted state.

```typescript
store.addModel('products', productsModel);
```

If you are utilizing an asynchronous storage engine then you should utilise the returned `resolveRehydration` helper.

```typescript                             ðŸ‘‡
const { resolveRehydration } = store.addModel('products', productsModel);
//            ðŸ‘†
// Deconstruct the returned object to get a handle on resolveRehydration

//     as we are using an asynchronous storage engine we will await the
// ðŸ‘‡ the promise returned by the resolveRehydration function.
resolveRehydration().then(() => {
  console.log('Rehydration is complete');
});
```

## Persisting multiple stores

If you utilise multiple stores, each with their own persistence configuration, you will need to ensure that each store is configured to have a unique name. The store name for each instance of your stores will be used within the persistence layer cache keys.

## Creating a custom storage engine

A storage engine is an object structure that needs to implement the following interface:

  - `getItem(key) => any | Promise<any> | void`

    This function will receive the key, i.e. the key of the model item being rehydrated, and should return the associated data from the persistence if it exists. It can alternatively return a `Promise` that resolves the data, or `undefined` if no persisted data was found.

  - `setItem(key, data) => void | Promise<void>`

    This function will receive the key, i.e. the key of the model data being persisted, as well as the associated data value. It should then store the respective data. It can alternatively return a `Promise` which indicates when the item has been successfully persisted.

  - `removeItem(key) => void | Promise<void>`

    This function will receive the key, i.e. the key of the model item that exists in the persistence, and should remove any data that is currently being stored within the persistence. It can alternatively return a `Promise` which indicates when the item has been successfully removed from the persistence.

## Creating a custom transformer

Easy Peasy outputs a [`createTransformer`](/docs/api/create-transformer.html) function, which has been directly copied from [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) in order to maximum compatiblity with it's ecosystem.
