# createTransform

Creates a transformer, which can be applied to [`persist`](/docs/api/persist.html) configurations.

Transformers are use to apply operations to your data during prior it being persisted or hydrated.

One use case for a transformer is to handle data that can't be parsed to a JSON string. For example a `Map` or `Set`. To handle these data types you could utilise a transformer that converts the `Map`/`Set` to/from an `Array` or `Object`.

This helper has been directly copied from [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist), with the intention of maximising our compatibility with the `redux-persist` ecosystem.

> [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) already has a robust set of [transformer packages](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#transforms) that have been built for it.

## API

The function accepts the following arguments:

  - `inbound` (data: any, key: string) => any; *optional*

    This function will be executed against data prior to it being persisted by the configured storage engine.

    This function will be executed against data prior after it is extracted from the configured storage engine.

  - `configuration` Object; *optional*

     Additional configuration for the transform. An object supporting the following properties.

     - `whitelist` Array&lt;string&gt;; *optional*

     - `blacklist` Array&lt;string&gt;; *optional*
