# useLocalStore

Allows you to create a store to represent the state for an individual React
component. This is essentially an alternative to the official `useState` and
`useReducer` hooks provided by React for component-level state.

```javascript
function MyCounter() {
  const [state, actions] = useLocalStore(() => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: action((_state) => {
      _state.count += 1;
    }),
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => actions.increment()}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API

The `useLocalStore` is a function described below.

### Arguments

- `modelCreater` ((prevState?: Object) => Object, _required_)

  A function that should return the model representing your store.

  The function receives the following arguments:

  - `prevState` (Object, _optional_)

    If the store is being recreated (i.e. due to a dependency change), then the
    previous state will be provided. This allows partial / full state
    rehydration.

- `dependencies` (Array, _optional_, _default_=[])

  A list of dependencies, similar to the official React hooks. If any of the
  values change then the store will be recreated. Especially helpful if your
  store depends on an external value, such as a prop.

  By default an empty array will be used, meaning the store will not be
  recreated.

- `storeConfig` ((prevState?: Object, prevConfig?: Object) => Object,
  _optional_)

  Allows you to customise the configuration options for your store. Please see
  the [StoreConfig](/docs/api/store-config.html) API documentation for a full
  list of configuration options.

  This will get called every time the `dependencies` array for your store
  changes.

  ```javascript
  useLocalStore(
    () => model,
    [],
    () => ({ middleware: [loggerMiddleware] }),
  );
  ```

  The function receives the following arguments:

  - `prevState` (Object, _optional_)

    If the store is being recreated (i.e. due to a dependency change), then the
    previous state will be provided. This allows partial / full state
    rehydration.

  - `prevConfig` (Object, _optional_)

    If the store is being recreated (i.e. due to a dependency change), then the
    previous config will be provided.

### Returns

It returns a positional array as described below;

```typescript
const [state, actions, store] = useLocalStore(/*...*/);
```

- `state`

  The state of your store.

- `actions`

  The actions of your store.

- `store`

  The actual store instance - for advanced cases.

## Tutorial

### Creating and using a local store

Utilising the `useLocalStore` hook is very simple if you are already familiar
with the primary APIs of Easy Peasy. It can easily be described via the
following concise example.

```javascript
import { useLocalStore } from 'easy-peasy';

function MyCounter() {
  const [state, actions] = useLocalStore(() => ({
    count: 0,
    inc: action((_state) => {
      _state.count += 1;
    }),
  }));
  return (
    <>
      <div>{state.count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => actions.inc()} type="button">
        {' '}
        +{' '}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Reinitialising your model based on incoming props

There may be cases in which you may want to reinitialize your store based on
some incoming props. The store hook will only initialize once for each use. To
get around this simply define the dependency array, providing a list of props,
that when they change will cause the store to be recreated.

```javascript
import { useLocalStore, action } from 'easy-peasy';

function EditProduct({ product }) {
  const [state, actions] = useLocalStore(
    () => ({
      product, // ğŸ‘ˆ using state to initialize model
      setPrice: action((_state, payload) => {
        _state.product.price = payload;
      }),
    }),
    [product], // ğŸ‘ˆ recreate model every time we receive a different product
  );

  return (
    <>
      <div>{state.product.name}</div>
      <input
        onChange={(e) => actions.setPrice(e.target.value)}
        value={state.product.price}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
