# reducer

Declares a section of state to be calculated via a "standard" reducer function - as is typical in Redux.

This API specifically exists to help with integrations against existing Redux based libraries, and to help with gradual migration from legacy Redux code.

For example [redux-first-history](https://github.com/salvoravida/redux-first-history), requires you to attach a reducer that they provide to your store.

```javascript
reducer((state = 1, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT': state + 1;
    default: return state;
  }
})
```

## Arguments

  - reducer (Function, required)

    The reducer function. It receives the following arguments.

    - `state` (Object, required)

      The current value of the property that the reducer was attached to.

    - `action` (Object, required)

      The action object, typically with the following shape.

      - `type` (string, required)

        The name of the action.

      - `payload` (any)

        Any payload that was provided to the action.

## Example

```javascript
import { createStore, reducer, useStoreState, useStoreDispatch } from 'easy-peasy';

const store = createStore({
  counter: reducer((state = 1, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT': state + 1;
      default: return state;
    }
  })
});

function Counter() {
  const count = useStoreState(state => state.counter);
  const dispatch = useStoreDispatch();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>
      {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```
