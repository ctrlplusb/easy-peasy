# Adding typed listeners

In the previous section we extended our [thunk](/docs/api/thunk) implementation so that it would create an audit log entry every time a todo was saved. This isn't the best design as the todos model shouldn't have to know about the audit model.

An alternative, cleaner approach, would be for the audit model to respond to the `addTodo` action, logging accordingly. We can achieve this via an [actionOn](/docs/api/action-on) listener. Let's refactor our implementation to do this.

## Defining an action that will act as our listener

Firstly, we will add a new [actionOn](/docs/api/action-on) listener to the interface definition for our audit model.

```typescript
import { ActionOn } from 'easy-peasy'; // ðŸ‘ˆ import the type
import { StoreModel } from './index';

interface AuditModel {
  log: string[];
  addLog: Action<AuditModel, string>;
  onTodoAdded: ActionOn<AuditModel, string, StoreModel>; // ðŸ‘ˆ new action listener
}
```

Note that we also provided the `StoreModel` to our `ActionOn` definition, this is because we anticipate that we will need to resolve an action from another part of our model. If your `ActionOn` instance was going to listen to an action that is local to the listener you wouldn't need to provide this argument.

## Implementing the actionOn listener

Now we will implement the [actionOn](/docs/api/action-on) listener, configuring to to listen to the `addTodo` [action](/docs/api/action).

```typescript
import { actionOn } from 'easy-peasy'; // ðŸ‘ˆ import the helper

const auditModel: AuditModel = {
  logs: [],
  addLog: action((state, payload) => {
    state.logs.push(payload)
  }),
  onTodoAdded: actionOn(
    // targetResolver resolving the addTodo
    (actions, storeActions) => storeActions.todos.addTodo,
    // action handler:
    (state, target) => {
      state.logs.push(`Added todo: "${target.payload}"`);
    },
  )
};
```

Now every time the `addTodo` [action](/docs/api/action) is fired our `onTodoAdded` listener will fire and add an audit log.

Remember, the [actionOn](/docs/api/action-on) listener will receive the same payload as the target [action](/docs/api/action). Therefore we need to ensure that the payload types will match across the listener and target. If they do not match a TypeScript error will occur warning you of this fact.

## Refactor the `saveTodo` thunk

We can now remove the call to the audit model within our `saveTodo` thunk.

```diff
const todosModel: TodosModel = {
  items: [],
  addTodo: action((state, payload) => {
    state.items.push(payload);
  }),
-  saveTodo: thunk(async (actions, payload, { getStoreActions, injections }) => {
+  saveTodo: thunk(async (actions, payload, { injections }) => {
    const { todosService } = injections;
    await todosService.save(payload);
    actions.addTodo(payload);
-    getStoreActions().audit.addLog(`Added todo: ${payload}`);
  }),
};
```
