# TypeScript Tutorial

Using TypeScript against your store can create a dramatically improved developer experience, making it far easier to consume your store and perform refactoring of it if required. Easy Peasy is bundled with robust TypeScript definitions to, allowing you to take advantage of this. We recommend using TypeScript >= 3.5.1 as this is the version we have built and tested them against, although >= 3.3 _should_ be okay.

This section will guide you through integrating and using TypeScript with Easy Peasy. It will start with the basics, focusing on state only, and then gradually introduce each of the APIs (e.g. [action](/docs/api/action), [thunk](/docs/api/thunk), etc).

We will be building a fully functional application along the way, using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) to host the demo. Each section will link to a specific [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) instance with the progress that we have made within each part of the tutorial.

If you aren't familiar with Easy Peasy then I would recommend that you first familiarise yourself with it by reading the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial).
