# Testing

This section introduces various techniques by which you can test your Easy Peasy implementation as well as it's integration with your application.

If you know of alternative strategies that you have found effective we would kindly invite you to submit a PR to get it added to this section.

The examples will be using [Jest](#todo) as the testing framework, however, the examples should be easily adaptable to your testing framework of choice.
