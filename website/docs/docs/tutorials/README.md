# Tutorials

These tutorials provide a deeper insight into using Easy Peasy. Whilst they cover the APIs pretty extensively we suggest that you also reference the individual API docs for further insight into the behaviour and edge cases of each API.

- [Standard Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/standard.html)

  Within this tutorial we will teach you the primary API of Easy Peasy, which will likely satisfy the 90% use case. This is a great place to start if you are new to the project.

- [Advanced Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/advanced.html)

  In this tutorial we will dive deeper into the more "complex" APIs of Easy Peasy, typically only necessary for applications with more bespoke state management needs. We'll cover some great concepts which will allow your store to scale with your application.

- [TypeScript Tutorial](/docs/tutorial/typescript.html)

  Here we will expand on the previous two tutorials, demonstrating how we can introduce end to end type safety across our application state via Easy Peasy's TypeScript support.
