Easy Peasy has full support for Typescript, via its bundled definitions.

We announced our support for Typescript via [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@ctrlplusb/easy-typed-state-in-react-with-hooks-and-typescript-eacd32901f05).

This section covers the primary types that are exported by the Easy Peasy definitions.

We have an [example repository](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy-typescript) which you can clone and run for a more interactive run through.
