**Should I choose Easy Peasy for my state management.**

The answer is yes. As compared to setting up state management using react-redux, Its much easier using Easy peasy and here is why;

 * No need to connect every component that needs to know about the app state or having to mapStateToProps

**Step 1 - Create your store**

```javascript
const store = createStore({
  todos: {
    items: ['Create store', 'Wrap application', 'Use store'],
    add: action((state, payload) => {
      state.items.push(payload)
    })
  }
});
```

**Step 2 - Wrap you application**

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <StoreProvider store={store}>
      <TodoList />
    </StoreProvider>
  );
}
```

**Step 3 - Use the store**

```javascript
function TodoList() {
  const todos = useStoreState(state => state.todos.items)
  const add = useStoreActions(actions => actions.todos.add)
  return (
    <div>
      {todos.map((todo, idx) => <div key={idx}>{todo}</div>)}
      <AddTodo onAdd={add} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
